# Flask-React-Game
This was a game I built to practice python.

I wanted to test package flask app as executable using PyInstaller as well as serving a React app with flask.

Using webpack was redundant since the app was already packaged with PyInstaller meaning that this needs to be built twice, once with webpack and once with PyInstaller. 

Lession learned.
