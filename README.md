# Flask-React-Game
This was a game I built to practice python.

I wanted to test packaging flask app as executable using PyInstaller as well as serving a React app with flask.

Webpack is part of my React boilerplate but It should have been removed from this since the app was already packaging with PyInstaller meaning that this needs to be built twice, once with webpack and once with PyInstaller.
